 * tasks dominate the bank and below-goal (A1) scaffolding is the scarce side. That is
 * the mirror image of a B2-goal sibling, and it is a property of the standard, not a
 * gap in the bank: there is only one level below A2 to scaffold from.
 *
 * Honest edges:
 *  - `atGoalPct === null` when the session served nothing at the goal → render
 *    "no estimate yet", never 0% (0% would lie about the learner, not the session).
 *  - foundational (below-goal) and above-goal tasks are reported as their own counts,
 *    not folded into the band — an easy below-goal win can't inflate goal-readiness,
 *    and a hard above-goal miss can't deflate it.
